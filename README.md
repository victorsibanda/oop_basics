#OOP BASICS

This repo will contain our OOP basics. 

- We will look at: 
 - Abstraction 
 - Encapsulation 
 - Inheritance 
 - Polymorphism 


*Usually you want your apps to Create,Read,Update and Delete

##Methods Vs Functions

Methods are function that belong to a specific data type. 
Where functions are anonymous and anything can call and run them 

##What is a class

- A class is like a cookie cutter that creates instances of cookies 
-  an instance is an occurence of something. 
- Classes will wrap characteristic as attributes, and behaviours as methods

#Characteristics of an object/ how an object looks like
These are attributes that are assigned to each instance.

## Self
- Refers to the instance of on which the method is called 
- self.name = 'ringo'
-This means that the specific object attribute will have the name ringo 

## Abstraction 
- This is when the programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and improve efficiency.
- Ability to hide complexity
- Done using Seperation of concerns, documentation and inheritance.
  - Specify methods and how to use them, that is Abstraction 

Real life Example:
- Cars
- Microwaves

## Encapsulation
- Each object are privately held inside a defined boundary, or class.
- Other objects do not have access to this class or the authority to make changes unless they reference it directly.
- Encapsulation improves the programâ€™s security and avoids unintended data corruption

## Inheritance
 - Developers can reuse common logic while maintaining a unique hierarchy by assigning relationships and subclasses between objects.
 - This forces more thorough data analysis, reduces development time and ensures a high level of accuracy.
 - Ability to pass to child class all the methods and characteristics.
 - You can reuse code - **OOP**

## Polymorphism
-  Objects can take multiple forms depending on the context.
- The program will determine which meaning or usage is necessary for each execution of that object, reducing the need to duplicate code.

- Ability to completely override methods, and if need be recall methods from parent class
using .super()
